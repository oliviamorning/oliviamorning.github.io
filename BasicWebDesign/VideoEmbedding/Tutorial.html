			<h2>Step 1 - Beginning</h2>
					<img src="Screenshot1.png" height="150px">
				<p>The first thing you want to do when embedding a video into your website is to have the proper code to begin. At the top, I have basic HTML code to get started. This incluede the <b>DOCTYPE</b>, the <b>language</b>, the <b>header with a title</b> embeded in it, and the <b>body</b> element.</p>
		</div>

			<h2>Step 2 - Getting Your Video</h2>
				<p>The second step is to find the video you want to use.<p> 
				<h3>Option 1</h3>
					<p>Many popular video services have an option to automatically copy code they created for you.</p>
					<p>To do this, click on the video's "Share" button, and then "Embeded" or &gt;/&lt;. In my example, I am using Vimeo.</p>

					<p>After that, you should see a window like this.</p>

					<p>Then, you copy the code and paste it into your text editor.</p>

				<h3>Option 2</h3>
					<p>The other way to obtain a video is by doing the code manually. This is helpful if the website you are using does not generate the code for you.</p>

						<img src="Screenshot6.png" height="200px">
					<p>Using the same video as an example, all you have to do is copy the video link by going to "Share", and then copying the link.</p>
		</div>

			<h2>Step 3 - Coding</h2>
			<p>The most inportant step-the actual code!<p>
				<h3>Option 1</h3>
					<img src="Screenshot7.png" height="150px">
					<p>If you went for Option 1 in Step 2, you're almost done! Once you copy and paste the code into your text editor, all you have to do is finish the code from the beginning, like your body and HTML tags. After that, you're all set!</p>
				<h3>Option 2</h3>
					<p>If the video you chose didn't generate code for you, there's no need to worry! It's simple to code.
					<p>The first thing you want to code is the <b>&lt;iframe&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</b> tag. Inside this tag, you should have the <b>source (src)</b>, <b>height</b>, <b>width</b> and <b>title</b> attributes.</p>
						<img src="Screenshot8.png" height="150px">
					<p>The "source" (or src) attribute is where you want to paste the link you got from the video in Step 2.</p>
						<img src="Screenshot9.png" height="150px">
					<p>For the "height" and "width" attributes, you can make it whatever size you want.</p>
					<p>***Note: the bigger you make the video, the longer loading time can be for your website viewers.</p>
						<img src="Screenshot10.png" height="150px">
					<p>The last thing you should have is a title. This just simply lets your viewers know what the video is.</p>
