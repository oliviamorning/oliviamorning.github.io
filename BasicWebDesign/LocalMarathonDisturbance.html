		<h2>Local Marathon Disturbance<h2>
		</hr>
		<p>This past Saturday, the Eau Claire area had their annual "Run for Research" marathon, where people from all over the region came to support cancer research. Over <em>400</em> people came out to run and support the cause!</p>
		<p>During this exciting event, however, a hippo from the local zoo was rumored to break loose. Although quickly caught at first, <b>Jessica the Hippo</b> later escaped captivity again, this time heading for disaster.</p>
		<blockquote>I was just running to support my cousin who is battling breast cancer, and all of a sudden I heard screams from all around me. When I turned around, this hippo was charging through the crowd! I was almost mauled, but I decided to dive to the side at the last second. That decision saved my life.<footer>-Anonymous Victim of Jessica</footer></blockquote>
		<p>Following this disaster, the leaders decided to postpone the marathon for next month, giving those mentally effected time to recover. Although only 3 injured, this moment has created a tremendous burden for all those in the race, as well as their families.</p>
